  Setting up and installing Katalon is really straight-forward. It as simple as
  downloading the Katalon application  and extracting and clicking the
  katalon.exe to launch it. That's it folks.

# Getting Started

## First things first.

Before you run the application, a few things keep in mind.

* You will be required to register with a FREE account. This login is what allows you access to plugins and their TestDevops feature. More on that later. 
* When you create a new Project, I highly recommend you create it in a seperate folder from where the actual Katalon program is being run. This helps if you plan on saving your code to a code repository, and just helps to keep the application separate from the code in general. As you use the more advance features it will make more sense.

### Where to Download
