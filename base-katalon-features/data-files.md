# Data Files

_\*\*\*\*_

\*\*\*\*â„¹ _**IMPORTANT: If you choose to create a data file that is using external data, such as an excel sheet, that excel sheet MUST be stored in Katalon Project, to ensure it gets checked in with the project. Put it in the directory /TestArtifacts. If you don't and file is not there, it will cause error for entire project when it tries to build it and it can't find that file if they project is ever downloaded and used else where.**_
