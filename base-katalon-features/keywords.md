# Keywords

Keywords allow you to extend Katalon with your own custom code. They are written using the [Groovy ](https://groovy-lang.org/)language. Groovy is a scripting language based off of Java, can think of it is as the "real" javascript. The cool thing about groovy is don't need to have a deep understanding of Java to use it. I would attest that you can learn it without knowing anything about Java.  When I first started working with Katalon, I didn't even know what Groovy was, and it was probably the easiest language I was able to work with. If you have a basic knowledge of programming, you'll do fine following their examples and then moving on from there.

The other cool aspect of this, is because Groovy is Java based, Katalon can be extended with Java code, and can use Java jars and import java packages into it for usage. Providing a huge library of options out there that can integrated into your automation without much effort.
