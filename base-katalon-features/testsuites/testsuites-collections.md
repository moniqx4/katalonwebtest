# TestSuites Collections

* They can be assigned specific profiles to be used with each Test Suite in that a test suite collection. For example, if you want to run regression on 3 different environments, and those environment settings were all using a different profile for each environment, you could assign a specific environment profile to each test suite in collection. 
* They also allow you to have specific browsers assigned and specific run configurations for each Test Suite as well. 
* They provide an option of running test sequentially or in parallel.
